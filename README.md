A more sophisticated RoamingRalphDemo. Extracted from the discontinued
Kultakoulu Software's original RPG game project. Fully working third-person
camera with a customizable relative position. The Witcher 1's styled. Contains
also a player that can walk or run on a terrain.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.6.7** (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/)
The version used for the development. Newer versions will work. Older versions
may work but I don't guarantee anything.
- **Panda3D 1.10.3** (https://www.panda3d.org/download/sdk-1-10-3/)
As above, version used for the development.

## Usage
```
pip3 install panda3d &&
cd tpp3d/src &&
./main.py
```
Then move and look around using the WSAD keys and a mouse. Toggle run or walk
by hitting the Shift key. Escape button will exit the app.
